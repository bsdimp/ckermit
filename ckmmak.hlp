CKMMAK.HQX is a Makefile for MacKermit.  It needs to be converted
by BinHex into a regular document.

To build MacKermit, use this Makefile with MPW C.  All the files you
need are here, except for environs.h and glueenvirons.a.0 from APDA.
These are distributed by Apple for free on AppleLink.  These are how
MacKermit tells that it's on an SE or a Mac II, and what version of
System is running.
