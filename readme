This branch contains a putative port to VENIX86.

It's not been compiled yet, or tested. I prepared it because it was
straight forward to do so from the 4F port. The 4F port can't compile
with the stock compiler, I suspect due to memory issues. 5A is much
larger, so more effort will be needed to get this to fit. the original
minix is known not to fit, and it has a similar memory model. I'm not
at all hopeful.
