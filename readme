This branch contains a putative port to VENIX86.

This contains a port for version 5A to venix.  As currently
configured, it's simply too big.  The makefile is too big. About a
third of the files don't compile due to space issues or some compile
problem. The rest that do already add up to over 64k once libc is
taken into account.

To run this version would require some serious thinning of kermit
somewhere, as well as some fixups to the code.

For at least the Rainbow version, it's unclear if there's a tangible
benefit of this release over prior releases. The UART and/or ca driver
effecitvely limit us to < 200cps/2400 baud regardless of the version
of kermit, so time would better be spent there as I know under DOS we
can get 9600 baud transfer rates.
