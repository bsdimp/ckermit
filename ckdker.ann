The new Kermit for the Data General computers is ready for initial release. 
This Kermit is the Unix Kermit version 4D(061) with DG-specific modules for
file I/O (ckdfio.c), terminal I/O (ckdtio.c), and the connect command
(ckdcon.c).  This version supports all the features that Unix Kermit provides,
except for the DIAL command and the SCRIPT command.  The program was developed
under AOS/VS rev 6 and rev 7.54, and with recompilation it may work on other
Data General systems, such as AOS/RT32 and MV/UX.  Version 3.21 of the C
compiler was used to develop the source. 


In addition to the usual features of C-Kermit, some additional features are
available for the DG Kermit. 

    * Data General wild cards and special symbols are supported when
      referencing files, including the following set: # + - * ^ = @
      
    * Fully qualified pathnames can be used to get or send files.  
      Sub-directories are entered if the # character is used.

    * DG and non-DG terminals are supported, so that character deletes occur
      correctly on-screen for any terminal device.
      
    * Batch mode operation is supported.
    
    * I/O redirection of the "xeq" command is supported.
    
    * Baud rates up to 38400 are supported, and other additional baud rates
      are supported (enter "help set baud" at the Kermit prompt).
      
    * Terminal emulation on a dial-out line from the DG is very fast, and has
      been tested up to 19200.

    * The initialization file, .kermrc, is executed even when Kermit is used
      in command line mode.
      
    * The local space command accepts a directory parameter.
    

Documentation is also supplied (ckdker.doc), which is adapted to the Data
General from the regular Unik Kermit document (ckuker.doc).  Installation
guidelines are included (ckdker.bld), and cli macros assist in compiling and
installing the source code.  A "beware" file lists all known bugs and quirks
(ckdker.bwr).
