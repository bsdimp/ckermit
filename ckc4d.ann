Subject: New (Minor) Release of C-Kermit for UNIX

This is to announce a new, minor release of C-Kermit for UNIX.  Because of
some mixups this past July, the new Amiga Kermit was installed in the Kermit
distribution with an inconsistent set of sources; the major reason for this
release is to remove this inconsistency.  Also, a few minor bugs are fixed.
Significant performance improvements and additional features will come in
future releases.  Here's a brief summary of what's in this new release:

Changes from Jack Rouse and Phil Julian of SAS Institute:
. Commodore Amiga support, replaces that from Davide Cervone of Rochester U.
  All-new CKI*.* files (this was announced in Info-Kermit v5 #3).
  This is the version written up in Jul/Aug 86 Amiga World.
. Revert CKUCMD.[CH] and CKUUS?.[CH] to their old selves (no more printf2,
  printf3, since these are no longer necessary for the Amiga), but add a
  few new Amiga specifics under #ifdef AMIGA conditionals.
. Fix multiline GET parsing to allow get back to top-level prompt if illegal
  local filename given (in CKUUSR.C).
. Supply a missing printf() parameter in CKWART.C.

Other changes:

Fix top-level parse loop in CKUUSR.C to reset any start state that might
erroneously have been set when a parse error has occurred.  Eliminates (for
instance) the spurious "?Sorry, you must set speed first" message if you
specify "foo bar" as the local filespec in multiline GET.

Make sysinit() return -1 if it fails, 0 if it succeeds, and have CKCMAI.C
check the return code.  Corresponding changes to invocation of sysinit in
CK[UVMI]IO.C.

Change references in CKUFIO.C to _file member of FILE structure to more
portable fileno() [suggested by Doug Orr, U of Mich].

In CKUFIO.C, change zclosf() to kill the fork before waiting for it to
terminate.

Fix Sys-V speed setting code (change "," to ";" between tttvt.c_cflag
statements) in CKUTIO.C.

Fix errpkt() function in CKCFN2.C to close open files, so that further
host commands can be done by the server after such a command is interrupted
abnormally [problem pointed out by Gregg Wonderly, Oklahoma State U].

Add Stan Barber's 4.3BSD acu control code to CKUTIO.C, under NEWUUCP
conditional.  I'm not sure if NEWUUCP needs to be defined in the makefile,
or what...

Version 4D(061) has been compiled and tested under Ultrix 1.1 (= 4.2BSD),
Ultrix 1.2 (whatever that may be a hybrid of), 2.9BSD on a DEC Pro/380, and
true 4.3BSD on a VAX 11/750 (4.3BSD includes an earlier version of C-Kermit
-- 4C(057) -- on its distribution tape).  The files that are new to this
version are in KER: on CU20B.  They are:

CKUCMD.C, CKUCMD.H, CKITIO.C
CKUUSR.C, CKUUSR.H, CKMTIO.C
CKUUS2.C, CKUUS3.C, CKVTIO.C
CKUFIO.C, CKUTIO.C
CKCMAI.C, CKUKER.UPD
