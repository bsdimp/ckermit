     _K_e_r_m_i_t is a file transfer program that allows files to be
     moved between many machine of different operating systems
     and architectures.  This man page describes version 4.2 of
     the program.

     Arguments are optional. If _k_e_r_m_i_t is executed without argu-
     ments, it will enter command mode. Otherwise, _k_e_r_m_i_t will
     read the arguments off the command line and interpret them.

     The following notation is used in command descriptions:

     ffffnnnn      A  Unix  file specification, possibly containing the
             "wildcard" characters '*' or '?' ('*' matches all
             character strings, '?' matches  any single charac-
             ter).

     ffffnnnn1111     A Unix file specification which may not contain '*'
             or '?'.

     rrrrffffnnnn     A  remote  file  specification in the remote
             system's own syntax, which may denote a single file
             or a group of files.

     rrrrffffnnnn1111    A remote file specification which should denote only
             a single file.

     nnnn       A decimal number between 0 and 94.

     cccc       A decimal number between 0 and 127 representing the
             value of  an  ASCII character.

     cccccccc      A  decimal  number  between 0 and 31, or else
             exactly 127, representing the value of an ASCII con-
             trol character.

     [[[[ ]]]]     Any field in square braces is optional.

     {{{{xxxx,,,,yyyy,,,,zzzz}}}} Alternatives are listed in curly braces.
     _K_e_r_m_i_t command line options may specify  either  actions  or
     settings.    If _K_e_r_m_i_t is invoked with a command line that
     specifies no actions, then it will issue a prompt and begin
     interactive dialog.   Action  options  specify  either pro-
     tocol transactions or terminal connection.

     ----ssss ffffnnnn   Send the specified file or files. If fn contains
             wildcard (meta) characters, the Unix shell expands
             it into a list.  If fn is  '-'  then _k_e_r_m_i_t sends
             from standard input, which must come from a file:

                         kermit -s - < foo.bar

             or a parallel process:

                         ls -l | kermit -s -

             You  cannot use this mechanism to send terminal
             typein.  If you want to send a file whose name is
             "-" you can precede it with a path  name,  as in

                         kermit -s ./-

     ----rrrr      Receive a file or files.  Wait passively for files
             to arrive.

     ----kkkk      Receive  (passively)  a file or files, sending them
             to standard output.  This option can be used in
             several ways:

                     kermit -k

             Displays  the  incoming  files  on  your screen; to
             be used only in "local mode" (see below).

                     kermit -k > fn1

             Sends  the  incoming file or files to the named
             file, fn1.  If more than one file arrives,  all  are
             concatenated  together  into  the single file fn1.

                     kermit -k | command

             Pipes the incoming data (single or multiple files)
             to the indicated command, as in

                     kermit -k | sort > sorted.stuff


     ----aaaa ffffnnnn1111  If you have specified a file transfer option, you
             may specify an alternate name for a single file with
             the -a option.  For example,

                     kermit -s foo -a bar

             sends the file foo telling the receiver that its
             name is bar.  If  more than  one  file  arrives or
             is sent, only the first file is affected by the -_a
             option:

                     kermit -ra baz

             stores the first incoming file under the name baz.

     ----xxxx      Begin server operation.  May be used in either local
             or remote mode.

     Before proceeding, a few words about remote and local opera-
     tion are  necessary.  _K_e_r_m_i_t is  "local"  if it is running
     on a PC or workstation that you are using directly, or if it
     is running on a multiuser system and transferring files over
     an  external  communication line -- not your job's control-
     ling terminal or console.  _K_e_r_m_i_t is remote if it is running
     on a multiuser system and  transferring files over its own
     controlling terminal's communication line, connected to your
     PC or workstation.

     If you are running _K_e_r_m_i_t on a PC, it is in local mode by
     default,  with  the "back  port"  designated for file
     transfer and terminal connection.  If you are running _K_e_r_m_i_t
     on a multiuser (timesharing) system, it is in remote mode
     unless you explicitly point it at an external line for file
     transfer or terminal connection.  The following command sets
     _K_e_r_m_i_t'_s "mode":

     ----llll ddddeeeevvvv  Line -- Specify a terminal line to use for file
             transfer  and  terminal connection, as in

                         kermit -l /dev/ttyi5

     When  an  external  line is being used, you might also need
     some additional options for successful communication with
     the remote system:

     ----bbbb nnnn Baud -- Specify the baud rate for the line given in the
          -_l option,  as in
                      kermit -l /dev/ttyi5 -b 9600

          This  option  should  always  be included with the -_l
          option, since the speed of an external line is not
          necessarily what you expect.

     ----pppp xxxx Parity -- e,o,m,s,n (even, odd, mark, space, or none).
          If  parity  is other  than none, then the 8th-bit pre-
          fixing mechanism will be used for transferring 8-bit
          binary data, provided the  opposite _K_e_r_m_i_t agrees. The
          default parity is none.

     ----tttt   Specifies  half  duplex,  line  turnaround  with  XON
          as the handshake character.

     The following commands may be used only with a _K_e_r_m_i_t which
     is local  -- either by default or else because the -_l option
     has been specified.

     ----gggg rrrrffffnnnn  Actively  request  a remote server to send the named
             file or files; rfn is a file specification in the
             remote host's own syntax.  If fn happens to  contain
             any  special  shell  characters,  like  '*', these
             must be quoted, as in

                         kermit -g x\*.\?

     ----ffff      Send a 'finish' command to a remote server.

     ----cccc      Establish a terminal connection over  the  specified
             or  default communication line, before any protocol
             transaction takes place.  Get back to  the  local
             system  by  typing  the  escape   character   (nor-
             mally Control-Backslash) followed by the letter 'c'.

     ----nnnn      Like -_c, but  after a protocol transaction takes
             place; -_c and -_n may both be used in the same com-
             mand.  The use of -_n and -_c is  illustrated below.
     On  a  timesharing  system, the -_l and -_b options will also
     have to be included with the -_r, -_k, or -_s options if the
     other _K_e_r_m_i_t is on a remote system.  If kkkkeeeerrrrmmmmiiiitttt is in local
     mode, the screen (stdout)  is  continously  updated  to show
     the  progress  of the file transer.  A dot is printed for
     every four data packets, other packets are shown by type
     (e.g.  'S'  for  Send-Init),  'T'  is printed  when there's
     a timeout, and '%' for each retransmission.  In addition,
     you may type (to stdin) certain "interrupt" commands during
     file transfer:


     Control-F:  Interrupt the current File, and go on to the
     next (if any).


     Control-B:  Interrupt the entire Batch of files, terminate
     the transaction.


     Control-R:  Resend the current packet


     Control-A:  Display a status report for the current transac-
     tion.

     These interrupt characters differ from the ones used in
     other Kermit implementations to  avoid  conflict with Unix
     shell interrupt characters.  With System III and System V
     implementations of Unix, interrupt commands must be  pre-
     ceeded by the escape character (e.g. control-\).
     Several other command-line options are provided:

     ----iiii      Specifies that files should be sent or received
             exactly "as is" with no conversions.  This option is
             necessary for transmitting  binary  files.  It may
             also be used to slightly boost efficiency in Unix-
             to-Unix transfers of text files by eliminating
             CRLF/newline conversion.

     ----wwww      Write-Protect -- Avoid filename collisions for
             incoming files.

     ----qqqq      Quiet -- Suppress screen update during file
             transfer, for  instance  to allow a file transfer to
             proceed in the background.

     ----dddd      Debug -- Record debugging information in the file
             debug.log in the current directory.  Use this option
             if you believe  the  program  is misbehaving, and
             show the resulting log to your local _k_e_r_m_i_t main-
             tainer.

     ----hhhh      Help -- Display a brief synopsis of the command line
             options.
     The command line may contain no more than one protocol
     action option.

     KKKKeeeerrrrmmmmiiiitttt executes the command and then prompts you for another
     command.  The process continues until you instruct  the pro-
     gram to terminate.  Commands  begin  with a keyword, nor-
     mally an English verb, such as "send".  You may omit trail-
     ing characters from any keyword, so  long  as  you  specify
     sufficient  characters  to  distinguish  it  from  any other
     keyword valid in that field.  Certain commonly-used keywords
     (such as "send",  "receive",  "connect") have  special
     non-unique abbreviations ("s" for "send", "r" for "receive",
     "c" for "connect").  Certain characters have special func-
     tions in interactive commands:

     ????       Question mark, typed at any point in a command, will
             produce a  message explaining  what  is  possible or

             the message may be a brief phrase, a menu of

             current keyword or filename, or insertion of a
             default value.  The result  will be a beep if the
             requested operation fails.

     DDDDEEEELLLL     (The  Delete  or  Rubout key) -- Delete the previous
             character from the command.  You may also use BS
             (Backspace, Control-H) for this function.

     ^^^^WWWW      (Control-W) -- Erase the rightmost word from the
             command line.

     ^^^^UUUU      (Control-U) -- Erase the entire command.

     ^^^^RRRR      (Control-R) -- Redisplay the current command.

     SSSSPPPP      (Space) -- Delimits fields (keywords, filenames,
             numbers) within a command.  HT (Horizontal Tab) may
             also be used for this purpose.

     CCCCRRRR      (Carriage  Return)  -- Enters the command for execu-
             tion.  LLLLFFFF (Linefeed) or FFFFFFFF (formfeed) may also be
             used for this purpose.

     \\\\       (Backslash) -- Enter any of the  above  characters
             into  the  command, literally.  To enter a
             backslash, type two backslashes in a row (\\).

     You  may  type  the editing characters (DEL, ^W, etc)
     repeatedly, to delete all the way back to the prompt.  No
     action will be performed until the  command  is entered by
     typing carriage return, linefeed, or formfeed.  If you make
     any mistakes, you will receive an informative error message
     and a new prompt  -- make liberal  use  of '?' and ESC to
     feel your way through the commands.  One important command
     is "help" -- you should use it the first time you run _K_e_r_-
     _m_i_t. Interactive _K_e_r_m_i_t accepts commands from files as well
     as from the  keyboard.  When  you  enter  interactive mode,
     _K_e_r_m_i_t looks for the file .kermrc in your home or current
     directory (first it looks in the home directory,  then  in
     the current  one) and executes any commands it finds there.
     These commands must be in interactive format, not Unix
     command-line format.  A "take" command is  also provided
     for use at any time during an interactive session.  Command
     files may be nested to any reasonable depth.  Here is a
     brief list of _K_e_r_m_i_t interactive commands:
