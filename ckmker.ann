Keywords: MacKermit 0.9(40)

This is to announce Macintosh Kermit 0.9(40), by Paul Placeway of
Ohio State University and Matthias Aebi of ECOFIN Research and Consulting, Ltd,
Zuerich.  MacKermit 0.9(40) runs on all Macs except the 128K original.  If you
have a 128K Mac, you should keep version 0.8(34), the last formal release.

As of 0.9, MacKermit has been translated into Apple MPW C, so that it can be
edited, compiled, and built on the Macintosh itself.  This translation was
based on work by Jim Noble of Planning Research Corporation, who converted
MacKermit 0.8(34) from SUMACC C (which had to be cross-compiled on a UNIX
system) to Megamax C.  Matthias converted Jim's version to MPW C, and he also
added many of the new features listed below.  After that, Paul Placeway
integrated the program with version 4E of C-Kermit and added additional new
features, also shown below.

 - Long packet support
 - The cursor with open desk accessories now works correctly
 - New program icon
 - New settings files are no longer TEXT
 - Settings can now be written back to an already existing settings file
 - Key redefinition function built in to Kermit, no more CKMKEY
 - Server mode directory listing feature
 - Multifile (folder) send
 - Server "Delete" file command
 - Server "Space" command
 - Get whole folder content from the server with filename ":"
 - Support of menu command keys (key macros)
 - Terminal settings dialog separated from communication settings
 - Non-transparent terminal mode
 - Display of statistics and protocol version to "About Kermit" dialog
 - Parity problems fixed
 - More efficient file transfer in many cases, especially when parity in use
 - Session logging (screen capture)
 - Transaction logging
 - Multifinder support
 - Additions to the VT102 emulator (smooth scrolling, etc)
 - Rearrangement of menus and displays
 - Program no longer hangs if remote response window gets too full
 - Program now works correctly on 64K ROM machines
 - A new manual

The new files are among those in KER:CK*.* on CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU, available
via anonymous FTP, and on BITNET, as CK* * from KERMSRV at CUVMA.  In
particular:

 CKMKER.HQX is the MacKermit application, in BinHex Version 4 format
 CKMKER.DOC is the new Kermit User Guide chapter for MacKermit
 CKMKER.MSS is the Scribe source for the manual chapter

If you want sources, the files you need (using Unix notation for brevity) are:
CK[CMU]*.[CHRW], that is, all files whose names start with CK, followed by C,
M, or U, and then some more characters, with a filetype of C, H, R, or W.  You
also need the file CKMMAK.HQX, which is the "makefile" in BinHex v4 format.

Thanks to all the Info-Kermit readers who have been beta-testing different
versions of this program since last October.  And many thanks to Paul and
Matthias for putting this release together and making it available.  Please
report any problems to Info-Kermit-Request@CU20B.
