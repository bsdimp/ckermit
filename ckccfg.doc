 APPENDIX I: SUMMARY OF COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS

1. OVERVIEW

This file gives more-or-less system-independent configuration information for
C-Kermit 5A and later.  The major topics covered include program size (and how
to reduce it), how to include or exclude particular features, notes on modem
and network support, and a list of C-Kermit's compile-time options.

For details about your particular operating system, consult the system-specific
installation instructions file:

  CK?INS.DOC

(? = U for UNIX, V for VMS, etc, for example, CKUINS.DOC for UNIX, CKVINS.DOC
for VAX/VMS, CKDINS.DOC for Data General AOS/VS, etc).  Also consult the
following files:

  CKAAAA.HLP   Explanation of file naming conventions
  CKCPLM.DOC   C-Kermit "program logic manual"
  CK?KER.HLP   System-specific help file, if any
  CK?KER.MAK   System-specific build procedure
  CKCKER.BWR   "Beware file": C-Kermit bugs, limitations, workarounds
  CK?KER.BWR   System-specific "beware file"
  CKCKER.UPD   User-level documentation for new features
  CKCnnn.UPD   Program edit history for edit nnn, e.g. CKC190.UPD.

2. SERIAL COMMUNICATION SPEEDS

These are defined in two places: the SET SPEED keyword list in the command
parser (as of this writing, in the ckuus3.c source file), and in the system-
dependent communications i/o module, CK?TIO.C, functions ttsspd() (set speed)
and ttgspd() (get speed).  The following speeds are assumed to be available
in all versions:

  0, 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600

If one or more of these speeds is not supported by your system, you'll need
to change the source code (this has never happened so far).  Other speeds
that are not common to all systems have Kermit-specific symbols:

               Symbol       Symbol
  Speed (bps)  to enable    to disable
       50       BPS_50       NOB_50
       75       BPS_75       NOB_75  
       75/1200  BPS_7512     NOB_7512
      134.5     BPS_134      NOB_134
      150       BPS_150      NOB_150
      200       BPS_200      NOB_200
     1800       BPS_1800     NOB_1800
     3600       BPS_3600     NOB_3600
     7200       BPS_7200     NOB_7200
    14400       BPS_14K      NOB_14K
    19200       BPS_19K      NOB_19K
    28800       BPS_28K      NOB_28K
    38400       BPS_38K      NOB_38K
    57600       BPS_57K      NOB_57K
    76800       BPS_76K      NOB_76K
   115200       BPS_115K     NOB_155K
   230400       BPS_230K     NOB_230K

The ckcdeb.h header file contains default speed configurations for the many
systems that C-Kermit supports.  You can override these defaults by (a)
editing ckcdeb.h, or (b) defining the appropriate enabling and/or disabling
symbols on the CC command line, for example:

  -DBPS_14400 -DNOB_115200

or the "make" command line, e.g.:

  make blah "KFLAGS=-DBPS_14400 -DNOB_115200"

Note: some speeds have no symbols defined for them, because they have never
been needed: 12.5bps, 45.5bps, 20000bps, etc.  These can easily be added if
required.

IMPORTANT: Adding one of these flags at compile time does not necessarily mean
that you will be able to use that speed.  A particular speed is usable only if
your underlying operating system supports it.  In particular, it needs to be
defined in the appropriate system header file (e.g. in UNIX, cd to
/usr/include and grep for B9600 in *.h and sys/*.h to find the header file
that contains the definitions for the supported speeds), and supported by the
serial device driver, and of course by the physical device itself.

3. FULLSCREEN FILE TRANSFER DISPLAY

New to edit 180 is support for an MS-DOS-Kermit-like local-mode full screen
file transfer display, accomplished using the curses library, or something
equivalent (for example, the Screen Manager on DEC VMS).  To enable this
feature, include the following in your CFLAGS:

  -DCK_CURSES

and then change your build procedure (if necessary) to include the necessary
libraries, usually "curses", perhaps also "termcap" or "termlib".  See
OS-dependent installation instructions and/or build procedure for details.  

New to edit 190 is the ability to refresh a messed-up full-screen display,
e.g. after receiving a broadcast message.  This depends on the curses package
including the wrefresh() and clearok() functions and the curscr variable.  If
your version has these, or has code to simulate them, then add:

  -DCK_WREFRESH

The curses and termcap libraries add considerable size to the program image
(e.g. about 20K on a SUN-4, 40K on a 386).  On some small systems, such as the
AT&T 6300 PLUS, curses support can push Kermit over the edge... even though it
compiles, loads, and runs correctly, its increased size apparently makes it
swap constantly, slowing it down to a crawl, even when the curses display is
not in use.  Some new makefile entries have been added to take care of this
(e.g. sys3upcshcc), but similar tricks might be necessary in other cases too.

Also new to edit 190 is an ASCII-graphic percent-done "thermometer".  This is
not included unless you add:

  -DCK_PCT_BAR

to your CFLAGS.

Just below the bar is a running display of the transfer rate, as a flat
quotient of file characters per elapsed seconds so far.  You can change this
to an average that gives greater weight to recent history (0.25 *
instantaneous cps + 0.75 * historical cps) by adding -DCPS_WEIGHTED to
your CFLAGS (sorry folks, this one is not worth a SET command).  You can
choose a second type of weighted average in which the weighting smooths
out progressively as the transfer progresses by adding -DCPS_VINCE to
-DCPS_WEIGHTED.

An alternative to curses is also available at compile time, but should be
selected if your version of Kermit is to be run in local mode only in an ANSI
terminal environment, for example on a desktop workstation that has an ANSI
console driver.  To select this option in place of curses, define the symbol
MYCURSES:

  -DMYCURSES

instead of CK_CURSES.  The MYCURSES option uses built-in ANSI (VT100) escape
sequences, and depends upon your terminal or console driver to interpret them
correctly.

To use the fullscreen display feature, SET FILE DISPLAY FULLSCREEN.  Beware, it
can slow the transfer down a bit (or a lot).  The faster the connection speed,
the more likely the fullscreen display will become the bottleneck.  To test
whether the fullscreen display is slowing your transfers down on a particular
connection, transfer the same with it and without it, and compare the figures
given in the STATISTICS command.  The default file transfer display is still
the old SERIAL ("dots") display, even if you build in curses support.

A compromise between the two styles (new to edit 183), that can be used on any
video display terminal, can be elected at runtime with the SET FILE DISPLAY
CRT.  It relies only on the ability of the terminal to write over the current
line when it receives a bare carriage return.  The same performance comments
apply to this display option.

4. CHARACTER SETS

By default, C-Kermit is built with support for translation of character sets
for Western European languages (i.e. languages that originated in Western
Europe, but are now also spoken in the Western Hemisphere and other parts of
the world), via ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1, for Eastern European languages
(ISO Latin-2), Hebrew (and Yiddish), and Cyrillic-alphabet languages (ISO
Latin/Cyrillic).  Many file (local) character sets are supported: ISO 646
7-bit national sets, IBM code pages, Apple, DEC, DG, NeXT, etc.

Japanese language support is available by defining the following symbol in
your CFLAGS (for example in UNIX, you can "make xxx KFLAGS=-KANJI"):

-DKANJI
   Japanese.
   Transfer character-set: Japanese EUC (= JIS X 0201 + JIS X 0208)
   File character-sets: EUC, JIS-7, DEC Kanji, Shift JIS

To build Kermit with no character-set translation at all, include -DNOCSETS in
the CFLAGS.  To build with no Latin-2, add -DNOLATIN2.  To build with no
Cyrillic, add -DNOCYRIL.  To omit Hebrew, add -DNOHEBREW.  If -DNOCSETS is
*not* included, you'll always get LATIN1.  There is presently no way to
include Latin-2, Cyrillic, Hebrew, or Kanji without also including Latin-1.

If Kanji support happens to be included in your version by default (as it is
for OS/2), but you don't want it, include add -DNOKANJI to your CFLAGS.

5. APC EXECUTION

The Kermit CONNECT module can be coded to execute Application Program Command
escape sequences from the host.  These are of the form:

  ESC _ text ESC \

where "text" is a C-Kermit command, or a list of C-Kermit commands separated
by commas, up to about 1K in length.

To date, this feature has been coded into the OS/2, Windows, VMS, OS-9, and
UNIX versions, for which the symbol:

  CK_APC

is defined automatically in ckuusr.h.  For OS/2, APC is enabled at runtime
by default, for UNIX it is disabled.  It is controlled by the SET TERMINAL
APC command.  Configuring APC capability into a version that gets it by
default (because CK_APC is defined in ckuusr.h) can be overridden by including:

  -DNOAPC

on the CC command line.

6. PROGRAM SIZE

C-Kermit 5A is a large program, much larger than version 4.x and earlier
because of all the new features, primarily the script programming language,
sliding window packet protocol, and international character set translation.
On some systems, the size of the program prevents it from being successfully
linked and loaded.  On some others, it occupies so much memory that it is
constantly swapping or paging.  In such cases, you can reduce C-Kermit's size
in various ways, outlined in this section.  The following options can cut down
on the program's size at compile time by removing features or changing the
size of storage areas.

6.1. When Memory Is Not a Problem

But first, also note that if "memory is no problem" on your system, you can
easily INCREASE the sizes of many things (buffers, command length, macro
length, maximum number of all sorts of things) simply by defining the
following symbol at compile time:

  BIGBUFOK

6.2. Removing Features

Features can be removed by defining symbols on the CC (C compiler) command
line.  "-D" is the normal CC directive to define a symbol so, for example,
"-DNODEBUG" defines the symbol NODEBUG.  Some C compilers might use different
syntax, e.g.  "-d NODEBUG" or "/DEFINE=NODEBUG".  For C compilers that do not
take command-line arguments, you can put the corresponding #define statements
in the file CKCSYM.H, for example:

#define NODEBUG

(The #define statement must be on the left margin.)  Here are C-Kermit's
size-related compile-time options.  The ones that take up the most space are
marked by asterisk (*).  If you are desperate to save space, remove debugging
first, rather than some more useful feature.  Remove built-in help only if
absolutely necessary.  The final resort is to remove the interactive command
parser completely, leaving only a UNIX-style command-line interface
("kermit -s foo").  This cuts the program down to about 25% of its fully
configured size.

* -DNODEBUG:  Add this option to omit all debugging code.
  -DNOTLOG:   Add this option to omit transaction logging.
* -DNOHELP:   Add this option to omit built-in help.
  -DTCPSOCKET:Remove this option to omit TCP/IP support.
  -DSUNX25:   Remove this option to omit SunLink X.25 support.
  -DNOMSEND:  Add this option to remove the MSEND command.
* -DNOLOCAL:  Add this option to remove all local-mode support.
* -DNODIAL:   Add this option to remove the DIAL command and modem support.
* -DMINIDIAL: Add this option to support only CCITT, Hayes, and Unknown modems.
* -DNOOLDMODEMS: Add this option to drop support for "old" modem types.
  -DNOXMIT:   Add this option to remove the TRANSMIT command.
  -DNOSCRIPT: Add this option to remove the UUCP-style SCRIPT command.
  -DNOCMDL:   Add this option to remove the command-line option interface.
* -DNOSPL:    Add this option to remove the script programming language.
* -DNOICP:    Add this option to remove the entire interactive command parser.
  -DDCMDBUF:  Add this option to allocate command buffers dynamically.
* -DNOCSETS:  Add this option to remove international character set support.
  -DNOLATIN2  Add this option to remove ISO Latin-2 character-set translation.
  -DNOCYRIL:  Add this option to remove Cyrillic character set translation.
  -DNOLATIN2: Add this option to remove Latin-2 character set translation.
  -DNOHEBREW: Add this option to remove Hebrew character set translation.
  -DKANJI:    Omit this option to exclude Kanji character set translation.
  -DNOESCSEQ: Add this option to omit ANSI escape sequence recognition.
  -DNOSERVER: Add this option to remove server mode.
  -DNOSETKEY: Add this option to remove the SET KEY command.
  -DNOPUSH:   Add this option to remove escapes to operating system.
  -DNOFRILLS: Add this option to remove "frills".
* -DCK_CURSES: Omit this option to keep the curses library out of Kermit.

  -DSBSIZ=nnnn -DRBSIZ=nnnnn
     Change the overall size of the packet send and receive buffers.

-DNOFRILLS removes various command synonyms; the following top-level commands:
CLEAR, DELETE, DISABLE, ENABLE, the multiline version of GET, GETOK, MAIL,
RENAME, TYPE, WHO; and the following REMOTE commands: KERMIT, LOGIN, LOGOUT,
PRINT, TYPE, WHO.

The CK_CURSES option, at least on UNIX, requires C-Kermit be linked with
a large external library.  On certain small systems, C-Kermit programs built
this way have been observed to cause swapping and/or performance problems.

6.3. Changing Buffer Sizes

There are options to control Kermit's packet buffer allocations.  The
following symbols are defined in ckcker.h in such a way that you can override
them by redefining them in CFLAGS:

  -DMAXSP=xxxx - Maximum send-packet length, default 2048.
  -DMAXRP=xxxx - Maximum receive-packet length, 2048 for UNIX, 1920 for VMS.
  -DSBSIZ=xxxx - Total allocation for send-packet buffers, default 3008.
  -DRBSIZ=xxxx - Total allocation for receive-packet buffers, default 3008.

The program size is affected by SBSIZ and RBSIZ (send and receive packet
buffer size).  These are static character arrays compiled into the program.
If you wish, you can have Kermit allocate packet buffers dynamically at
runtime using malloc() by including the CFLAGS switch:

  -DDYNAMIC

In this case, the default packet and buffers sizes are changed to:

  -DMAXSP=9024 (for UNIX, 2048 for VMS)
  -DMAXRP=9024 (for UNIX, 1920 for VMS)
  -DSBSIZ=9050
  -DRBSIZ=9050

but you can change the packet buffer sizes (not the maximum packet size) at
runtime using the command:

  SET BUFFERS <sbsiz> <rbsiz>

Using dynamic allocation (-DDYNAMIC) reduces storage requirements for the
executable program on disk, and allows more and bigger packets at runtime.
But dynamic allocation might not work on all systems.  Try it.  If it works
for you, there is no reason not to use it.  But if the program hangs or core
dumps, then omit the -DDYNAMIC option from CFLAGS.

6.4. Other Size-Related Items

To make Kermit compile and load successfully, you might have to change your
build procedure to:

   a. Request a larger ("large" or "huge") model.  This is particularly true
      for 16-bit PC-based UNIX versions.  This is typically done with a -M
      and/or -F switch (see your cc manual or man page for details).

   b. Some systems support overlays.  If the program is too big to be built
      as is, check your loader manual ("man ld") to see if an overlay feature
      is available.  See the 2.10/2.11 BSD example in the UNIX makefile. 

   c. Similarly, some systems support "code mapping", which is similar to
      overlays.  Again, see "man ld".

It is also possible to reduce the size of the executable program file in
several other ways:

   a. Include the -O (optimize) compiler switch if it isn't already included
      in your "make" entry (and if it works!).  If your compiler supports
      higher levels of optimization (e.g. -O2), try it.

   b. If your UNIX system supports shared libraries, change the make entry to
      take advantage of this feature.  The way to do this depends on your
      particular system.  Some (like SUNOS) do it automatically.  See the NeXT
      entry for an example.

   c. Strip the program image after building ("man strip" for further info),
      or add -s to the LNKFLAGS (UNIX only).  This strips the program of its
      symbol table and relocation information.

   d. Move character strings into a separate file.  See the 2.10 BSD entry
      for an example.

6.5. Space/Time Tradeoffs

There are over 2000 debug() statements in the program.  If you want to save
both space (program size) and time (program execution time), include -DNODEBUG
in the compilation.  If you want to include debugging for tracking down
problems, omit -DNODEBUG from the make entry.  But when you include debugging,
you have two choices for how it's done.  One definition defines debug() to be
a function call; this is cheap in space but expensive in execution.  The other
defines debug as "if (deblog)" and then the function call, to omit the
function call overhead when the debug log is not active.  But this adds a lot
of space to the program.  Both methods work, take your choice; IFDEBUG is
preferred if memory is not a constraint but the computer is likely to be slow.
The first method is the default, i.e. if nothing is done to the CFLAGS or in
ckcdeb.h (but in some cases, e.g. VMS, it is).  To select the second method,
include -DIFDEBUG in the compilation (and don't include -DNODEBUG).

7. DIALER SUPPORT

-DNODIAL removes automatic modem dialing completely, including the entire
ckudia.c module, plus all commands that refer to dialing in the various
ckuus*.c modules.

-DMINIDIAL leaves the DIAL and related commands (SET/SHOW MODEM, SET/SHOW DIAL)
intact, but removes support for all types of modems except CCITT, Hayes,
Unknown, and None (= Direct).  The MINIDIAL option cuts the size of the dial
module approximately in half.  Use this option if you have only Hayes or
CCITT modems and don't want to carry the baggage for the other types.

Note that MINIDIAL is quite sufficient to control any type of modem that uses
the Hayes command and response set, even modern high-speed, error-correcting,
data-compressing ones, if you use a macro such as the ones listed in the
CKCKER.BWR file (such as PPDIAL) to set up the modem's initialization string,
etc.  In fact, it might ultimately make good sense to replace the bulk of the
DIAL module with a set of macros for each brand of modem, as in MS-DOS Kermit.

A compromise between full dialer support and MINIDIAL is obtained by removing
support for "old" modems -- all the strange non-Hayes compatible 1200 and 2400
bps modems that C-Kermit has been carrying around code for since 1985 or so.
To remove support for these modems, add -DNOOLDMODEMS to CFLAGS at compilation
time.

Finally, if you keep support for old modems, you will notice that their names
appear on the "set modem ?" menu.  That's because their names are, by default,
"visible".  But the list is confusing to the younger generation, who have only
heard of modems from the V.32bis-and-later era.  If you want to be able to
use old modems, but don't want their names cluttering up menus, add this to
CFLAGS:

  -DM_OLD=1

8. NETWORK SUPPORT

C-Kermit supports not only RS-232 serial connections, direct and modem, but
also TCP/IP and X.25 network connections.  The OS/2 version supports DECnet
(LAT) connections.  If you define the following symbol:

  NONET

then all network support will be compiled away.

8.1. TCP/IP

TCP/IP support requires the Berkeley sockets library, and is generally
available on any UNIX system.  It is also available in OS/2, VMS, AOS/VS, VOS,
etc.  The TCP/IP support includes built-in TELNET negotiation handling.  To
select TCP/IP support, include -DTCPSOCKET in your makefile entry's CFLAGS, or
the appropriate variant (e.g. -DWOLLONGONG, -DMULTINET, -DEXCELAN, -DWINTCP,
etc).  The network support for TCP/IP and X.25 is in the source files CKCNET.H
and CKCNET.C, with miscellaneous SHOW commands, etc, in the various CKUUS*.C
modules, plus code in the CK*CON.C (CONNECT command) and several other modules
to detect TELNET negotiations, etc.

Within the TCPSOCKET code, some socket-level controls are included if
TCPSOCKET is defined in the C-Kermit CFLAGS and SOL_SOCKET is defined in
in the system's TCP-related header files, such as <sys/socket.h>.  These are

  SET TCP KEEPALIVE
  SET TCP LINGER
  SET TCP RECVBUF
  SET TCP SENDBUF

In addition, if TCP_NODELAY is defined, the following command is also
enabled:

  SET TCP NODELAY (Nagle algorithm)

See the user documentation for descriptions of these commands.

8.1.1. Firewalls

There exist various types of firewalls, set up allow separate users of an
internal TCP/IP network from the great wide Internet.  Of course, this could
be accomplished most easily and safely by simply not connecting the internal
network to the Internet, but in many cases some restricted forms of access are
needed.  Thus a "firewall" is set up to allow only authorized accesses.

One firewall method is called SOCKS, in which a proxy server allows users
inside a firewall to access the outside world, based on a permission list
generally stored in a file.  SOCKS is enabled in one of two ways.  First, the
standard sockets library is modified to handle the firewall, and then all the
client applications are relinked (in systems where linking is not dynamic)
with the modified sockets library.  The APIs are all the same, so the
applications do not need to be recoded or recompiled.

In the other method, the applications must be modified to call replacement
routines, such as Raccept() instead of accept(), Rbind() instead of bind(),
etc, and then linked with a separate SOCKS library.  This second method is
accomplished in C-Kermit by including -DCK_SOCKS in your CFLAGS, and also
adding:

  -lsocks

to LIBS, or replacing -lsockets with -lsocks (depending on whether the socks
library also includes all the sockets entry points).

Explicit firewall support can, in general, not be a standard feature or a
feature that is selected at runtime, because the SOCKS library tends to be
different at each site -- local modifications abound.

The ideal situation occurs when firewalls are supported by the first method,
using dynamically linked sockets-replacement libraries; in this case, all your
TCP/IP client applications will negotiate the firewall transparently.

8.1.2. Solving Compilation and Linking Problems

If you get a compilation error in CKCNET.C, with a complaint like
"incompatible types in assignment", it probably has something to do with the
data type your system uses for the inet_addr() function, which is declared
(usually) in <arpa/inet.h>.  Kermit uses "unsigned long" unless the symbol
INADDRX is defined, in which case "struct inaddr" is used instead.  Try adding
-DINADDRX to CFLAGS in your make entry, and if that fixes the problem, please
send a report to kermit@columbia.edu.

Compilation errors might also have to do with the data type used for
getsockopt() and setsockopt() option-length field.  This is normally an int,
but sometimes it's a short, a long, or an unsigned any of those, or a size_t.
To fix the compilation problem, add -DSOCKOPT_T=xxx to the CFLAGS in your
makefile entry, where xxx is the appropriate type (use "man getsockopt" or
grep through your system/network header files to find the needed type).

8.1.3. Enabling Host Address Lists

When you give Kermit an IP host name, it calls the socket routine
gethostbyname() to resolve it.  gethostbyname() returns a hostent struct,
which might or might not not include a list of addresses; if it does, then
if the first one fails, Kermit can try the second one, and so on.  However,
this will only work if the symbol "h_addr" is a macro defined as
"h_addr_list[0]", usually in netdb.h.  If it is, then you can activate this
feature by defining the following symbol in CFLAGS:

  HADDRLIST

8.1.4. Enabling Telnet NAWS

TELNET Negotiation About Window Size (NAWS) support requires the ability to
find out the terminal screen's dimensions.  E.g. in UNIX, we need something
like ioctl(0, TIOCGWINSZ, ...).  If your version of Kermit was built with NAWS
capability, SHOW VERSIONS will include CK_NAWS among the compiler options.  If
it doesn't, you can add it by defining CK_NAWS at compile time.  Then, if the
compiler or linker complain about undefined or missing symbols, or there is no
complaint but SHOW TERMINAL fails to show reasonable "Rows =, Columns ="
values, then take a look at (or write) the appropriate ttgwsiz() routine.  On
the other hand, if CK_NAWS is defined by default for your system (in ckcnet.h),
but causes trouble, you can override this definition by including the -DNONAWS
switch on your CC command line, thus disabling the NAWS feature.

This appears to be needed at least on the AT&T 3B2, where in ckutio.c,
the routine ttgwsiz() finds that the TIOCGWINSZ symbol is defined but lacks
definitions for the corresponding winsize struct and its members ws_col
and ws_row.

The UNIX version of C-Kermit also traps SIGWINCH, so it can send a NAWS any
time the console terminal window size changes, e.g. when you stretch it with a
mouse.  The SIGWINCH-trapping code is enabled if SIGWINCH is defined (i.e. in
signal.h).  If this code should cause problems, you can disable it without
disabling the NAWS feature altogether, by defining NOSIGWINCH at compile time.

8.1.5. Enabling Incoming TCP/IP Connections

This feature lets you "set host * <port>" and wait for an incoming connection
on the given port.  This feature is enabled automatically at compile if
TCPSOCKET is defined and SELECT is also defined.  But watch out, simply
defining SELECT on the cc command line does not guarantee successful
compilation or linking (see section 11).

If you want to disable incoming TCP/IP connections, then build C-Kermit
with:

  -DNOLISTEN

8.1.6. Disabling "SET TCP" Options.

The main reason for this is because of header file / prototype conflicts at
compile time regardting get/setsockopt().  If you can't fix them (without
breaking other builds), just include the following in CFLAGS:

  -DNOTCPOPTS


8.2. X.25

X.25 support requires (a) a SUN, (b) the SunLink product (libraries and header
files), and (c) an X.25 connection into your SUN, or else Stratus VOS and the
appropriate X.25 development tools.

In UNIX, special makefile entries sunos4x25 and sunos41x25 (for SUNOS 4.0 and
4.1, respectively) are provided to build in this feature, but they only work
if conditions (a)-(c) are met.  To request this feature, include -DSUNX25 in
CFLAGS.

SUNX25 and TCPSOCKET can be freely mixed and matched.

8.3. Other Networks

Support for other networking methods -- NETBIOS, LAT, Named Pipes, etc --
is included in CK*NET.H and CK*NET.C for implementations (such as OS/2) where
these methods are supported.

Provision is made in the organization of the modules, header files, commands,
etc, for addition of new network types such as DECnet, X.25 for other systems
(HP-UX, VMS, etc), and so on.  Send email to kermit@columbia.edu if you are
interested in working on such a project.

9. EXCEPTION HANDLING

The setjmp/longjmp mechanism is used for handling exceptions.  The jump
buffer is of type jmp_buf, which almost everywhere is typedef'd as an array,
in which case you should have no trouble compiling the exception-handling
code.  However, if you are building C-Kermit in/for an environment where
jmp_buf is something other than an array (e.g. a struct), then you'll have
to define the following symbol:

  JBNOTARRAY

10. SECURITY FEATURES

Compiling with the NOPUSH symbol defined removes all the "shell escape"
features from the program, including the PUSH, RUN, and SPAWN commands, the
"!"  and "@" command prefixes, OPEN !READ, OPEN !WRITE, job control (including
the SUSPEND command), the REDIRECT command, shell/DCL escape from CONNECT
mode, as well as the server's execution of REMOTE HOST commands (and, of
course, the ENABLE HOST command).  Add NODISPO to also prevent acceptance of
incoming MAIL or REMOTE PRINT files.  For UNIX, also be sure to read
CKUINS.DOC about set[ug]id installation.  Additional restrictions can be
enforced when in server mode; read about the DISABLE command.

Compiling with NOCCTRAP prevents the trapping of SIGINT by Kermit.  Thus
if the user generates a SIGINT signal (e.g. by typing the system's interrupt
character), Kermit will exit immediately, rather than returning to its
prompt.

NOPUSH and NOCCTRAP together allow Kermit to be run from restricted shells,
preventing access to system functions.

11. ENABLING SELECT()

Kermit works best if it can do nonblocking reads, nondestructive input buffer
checking, and millisecond sleeps.  All of these functions are best
accomplished by the select() function, which, unfortunately, is not
universally available.  Furthermore, select() is required if incoming TCP/IP
connections are to be supported.

select() was introduced with Berkeley UNIX, rejected by AT&T for System V,
but is gradually creeping in to all UNIX versions (and other operating systems
too) by virtue of its presence in the sockets library, which is needed for
TCP/IP.  AT&T SVID for System V R4 includes select(), but that does not mean
that all SVR4 implementations have it.

Other alternatives include poll() and rdchk().  Only one of these three 
functions should be included.  The following symbols govern this:

  SELECT  Use select() (BSD, or systems with sockets libraries)
  CK_POLL Use poll()   (System V)
  RDCHK   Use rdchk()  (SCO)

If your system supports the select() function, but your version of C-Kermit
does not, try adding:

  -DSELECT

to the CFLAGS, and removing -DRDCHK or -DCK_POLL if it is there.  If you get
compilation errors, some adjustments to ck*tio.c and/or ck*net.c might be
needed; search for SELECT (uppercase) in these files (note that there are
several variations on the calling conventions for select()).

Various macros and data types need to be defined in order to use select().
Usually these are picked up from <types.h> or <sys/types.h>.  But on some
systems, they are in <sys/select.h>.  In that case, add the following:

  -DSELECT_H

to the CFLAGS to tell C-Kermit to #include <sys/select.h>.  A good indication
that you need to do this would be if you get compile-time complaints about
"fd_set" or "FD_SET" not being declared or defined.

WARNING: Some implementations of select() only work with file descriptors that
were created by socket() and opened by connect() or accept().  This is
evidently true on (at least) AOS/VS and BeOS.  Who knows where else.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
APPENDIX I: SUMMARY OF COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS

These are the symbols that can be specified on the cc command line, listed
alphabetically.  Others are used internally, including those taken from header
files, those defined by the compiler itself, and those inferred from the ones
given below.  Kermit's SHOW VERSIONS command attempts to display most of
these.  See ckcdeb.h and ckcnet.h for inference rules.  For example SVR3
implies ATTSV, MULTINET implies TCPSOCKET, and so on.

The following options are not included in all makefile entries, but they are
beneficial if they work.  It is recommended that you add them to your makefile
entry if they are lacking and test the result.  If it's OK, let me know and
I'll add them to the official makefile:

DYNAMIC        Dynamic packet buffer allocation, bigger packets allowed, etc.
NOSETBUF       Don't do unbuffered single-character writes to the console.
