To build the program, collect all the files together into a single directory,
preferably on a hard disk, and then give a "make" command for the desired
system, e.g. "make bsd", "make sys3", "make xenix", etc.  Read the makefile
for details.

Be sure to read the CKUKER.BWR file before trying to use this version, or
reporting any problems with it.
