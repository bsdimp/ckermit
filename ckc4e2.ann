Subject: Announcing C-Kermit 4E(068)
To: Info-Kermit@CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU, Info-Unix@BRL.ARPA
Message-ID: <12369278369.17.SY.FDC@CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU>

This is to announce another minor release, but this time a "real" release,
of C-Kermit for Unix, VAX/VMS, Data General AOS, the Commodore Amiga,
the Apple Macintosh, etc.  The changes were minor, and only appear in the
Unix versions.  They include:

. Suspendibility via Ctrl-Z on systems with job control (Bob Brown).
. Explicit support for SCO Xenix in the Makefile (from D.W. Bettinger).
. Explicit support for the AT&T 7300, including the ability to dial its
  internal modem (from R.E. Hill, untested).
. Improved response of the C-Kermit server to 'remote cwd' commands.
. Miscellaneous small fixes and cleanups.

The major change is that since this is now considered a real release,
the files have been named from XK*.* back to CK*.*, and the XK*.* files
are gone, resulting in a savings of about 2 megabytes in our Kermit
distribution area and on our tapes.

All files' names changed, but the only files whose contents changed are:

 ckuker.upd - Update history
 ckuker.bwr - Beware file
 ckcfns.c   - Functions (better reporting of current directory by server)
 ckcmai.c   - Main program (new version number)
 ckcpro.c   - Protocol module (wart output)
 ckudia.c   - Dial module (ATT 7300 support added)
 ckuusr.c   - New calls
 ckutio.c   - Support for ATT 7300, job control fixes
 ckufio.c   - New zgtdir() function to return current directory
 ckdfio.c   - Ditto (but dummy)
 ckifio.c   - Ditto (but dummy)
 ckmfio.c   - Ditto (but dummy)
 ckvfio.c   - Ditto (but dummy)
 ckwart.c   - Syntax error fixed

These files are in K2: on CU20B.COLUMBIA.EDU, e.g. K2:CKCFNS.C, available via
anonymous FTP.  They are also available on BITNET from KERMSRV@CUVMA as
CKCFNS C, etc.  For information about using KERMSRV to get Kermit files,
send a message to KERMSRV@CUVMA with the message text saying "help".

Please report any problems with this release to Info-Kermit@CU20B.
