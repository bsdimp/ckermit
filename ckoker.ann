                       Announcing C-Kermit for OS/2

A version of C-Kermit for OS/2 is now available for beta testing.  Any bugs,
suggestions or complaints should be sent to C.Adie@uk.ac.edinburgh.  This
first version is 1.0b - the 'b' indicates it is a pre-release version.

C-Kermit runs in OS/2 protected mode, so you can transfer files in the
background while doing something else in the foreground.  If you do a
lot of file transfer, it may be worthwhile upgrading to OS/2 for this
reason alone. 

A full VT100 emulator is incorporated, with an extended display buffer
like MS-Kermit.

I've used the letter 'O' as the system-specific identifier for OS/2, so
the release files are named as follows:
      CKOKER.EXE      The executable program
      CKOKER.DOC      Documentation
The sources for the program and the Scribe source for the documentation
will be made available when beta testing is over.

C-Kermit for OS/2 runs on OS/2 Standard edition 1.0 (or on 1.1 in a
Presentation Manager window).  It makes use of the COM01.SYS (or perhaps
COM.SYS in some versions of OS/2) device driver, which must be loaded in
the CONFIG.SYS file.  There are believed to be no major bugs, but the
following minor problems exist:

*  Stop bits: There is currently no  mechanism for altering the number of  stop
   bits, which is fixed at 1.
*  Server breakout:  There is  no way  of stopping  server operation  from  the
   keyboard, short of Control-Break.
*  Dial: The DIAL command has not  been tested.  It is impossible to  terminate
   the dialling process short of pressing Control-Break.
*  Multiple copies: Multiple  copies of Kermit  accessing multiple comms  ports
   simultaneously has not been tested.
*  Multiple send from command line:  At present, a wildcard file  specification
   cannot be given as the argument to the '-s' command line option.  Thus, only
   a single file can be sent using a command line.
*  Half-duplex terminal emulation does not work correctly.

There are also some further minor bugs or areas for improvement which are
detailed at the end of the documentation.

Subject: OS/2 kermit, here it is!!!

This is to announce a new version of C-Kermit for OS/2.  Version 1.0p
fixes a number of bugs in the VT100 terminal emulator, which is now
upgraded to a VT102.  Many thanks to all those who commented on the
previous releases, and particularly to Kevin Lowey at the University of
Saskatchewan and to Peter White of the University of New Brunswick for
their advice on the emulation.  The documentation is also updated, to
explain better the interaction of Kermit with the OS/2 MODE utility.

If no bugs are reported to me by Monday 1st May 1989, this version
will become the first full (ie. non-beta-test) release of C-Kermit for
OS/2, at which point the version number will be changed to 1.0 and the
sources will be released.

Please send bug reports to "C.J.Adie@edinburgh.ac.uk"
