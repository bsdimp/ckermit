This directory contains C-Kermit version 4F(095), which was never formally
released.  It is an upgrade of version 4E(072).  Its major new feature is
attribute packets.  The VMS support files, ckv*.*, are known to be
inconsistent with the mainline cku*.* and ckc*.* files.  These files are
kept as a fallback for version 5A of C-Kermit, which is much bigger.  There
may be computers for which version 5A is too big, and version 4F will still
fit...

NOTE: This brnach contains an attempted port to Venix86. The compiler barfs
"ckcfn2.c", line 304: compiler error: no table entry for op OREG
which seems to be because it's run out of memory. This is with -O and without
which is the usual fix for such conditions. One could try to split this
file, I guess, but I don't need attribute packets. Anybody else attempting
to use this on these now-ancient boxes has been warned.
