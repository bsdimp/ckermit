The diskette is in UNIX "tar" format, created using the command like "tar cf
/dev/ra2c ckuker.* kermit".  You should read the files from disk using a
command like "tar xf /dev/ra2c" (the actual device name of your RX50 drive
may differ).  The man page may be viewed by doing "nroff -man ckuker.nr | more"
and you may install it as a regular man page by storing this file in the
appropriate directory under the name kermit, e.g. /usr/man/man1/kermit.1.
