Subject: Announcing C-Kermit 4E(070) (Sorry!)
Keywords: C-Kermit 4E(070), UNIX Kermit

This is to announce, directly on the heels of C-Kermit 4E(068), another new
version, 4E(070).  I apologize for this.  Edit 68 had two fatal flaws,
which are described in messages below, but briefly:

 . getcwd() not defined in BSD UNIX, breaking BSD versions.
 . Unconditional reference to SIGSTOP, breaking non-BSD versions.

A couple other small fixes were also applied.  One is for the error message
C-Kermit returns when it times out (thanks to Paul Placeway).  The other
finally allows Kermit to determine whether it is running in the background, so
that the "disappearing prompt" problem is fixed...  But only for Berkeley and
Ultrix versions.  See messages below.

Sorry for the inconvenience.  If you want to replace the files that were
"damaged" in the 068 release, they are ckutio.c, ckufio.c, ckuusr.c,
ckcfn2.c, ckucmd.c, and ckcmai.c.
