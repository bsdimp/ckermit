; CKURZSZ.INI -- UNIX C-Kermit X/Y/ZMODEM extern protocol macros.
;
; F. da Cruz and C. Gianone, Columbia University, July 1994.
; Modeled after earlier non-REDIRECT macros by Rick Calder at AT&T.
;
; Most recent update: Mon Sep  5 13:00:32 1994
;
; NOTE: This file is obsolete as of C-Kermit 6.0, which supports
; external protocols directly with its SET PROTOCOL command.
;
; UNIX C-Kermit Macros to run UNIX Xmodem, Ymodem, and Zmodem as external
; protocols when C-Kermit is in local mode, i.e. over SET LINE, SET HOST, or
; TELNET connections.
;
; To use, "take ckurzsz.ini" to define the following macros:
;
;   SX - Send with Xmodem    RX - Receive with Xmodem
;   SB - Send with Ymodem    RB - Receive with Ymodem
;   SZ - Send with Zmodem    RZ - Receive with Zmodem
;
; Each macro each takes the same arguments as the corresponding UNIX program.
; No validation is performed on the arguments except to ensure that the
; minimum number of them is supplied in each case.  If so, the program is run
; with the given arguments with its input and output redirected to Kermit's
; communication channel.  If not, the macro prints an error message and fails.
;
; It is assumed that sx, rx, sb, rb, sz, and rz are in your UNIX PATH, and
; that they are the pre-1989 versions that allow their standard input and
; output to be redirected.
;
; If this version of C-Kermit has the REDIRECT command, it is used and these
; macros will work no matter what your shell is.  Otherwise your current shell
; must be ksh or bash for i/o redirection of \v(ttyfd).  Note: both ksh and
; bash report themselves as /bin/ksh (or /usr/bin/ksh) via the SHELL
; environment variable.
;
; DISCLAIMER:

;   These macro definitions are included with C-Kermit as a convenience to
;   users of sz/rz.  Columbia University is not a source for the sz/rz
;   software, nor does it support sz/rz in any way.  For further information
;   about sz/rz and related products, contact:
